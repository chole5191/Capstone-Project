One can say that the only thing he concerns is the place itself, but after few days of moving, he will soon get care about the infrasture, safety and other considerations. As we can notice from Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, seeking for a safe and secure place is human's basic needs. It also implies once these desires are not fullfilled, feeling an accomplisments and obtaning your prestige would be behind the back. \n And there are various positive effects when people live in a great neigborhood. First, good places promote intimacy. In a good neighborhood, it is more likely to talk into people you know and you want to bring your friends and family to your place. Secondly, if you raise a child, neighborhood quality has siginificant and long term effects on child and adolescent problem behaviors according to Johns Hopkins School. With all the other reasons, people want to live near the main shopping street, a park, a library, playground etc.\n\n#### From this project, i'd like to help those who want to move to Scarborough by looking up median housing price and crime rates of the area, weather conditions, good management of emergency, road connectivity and so on. This will be a good indicator to lead a good neighborhood."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": ""}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
